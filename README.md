Adapted from https://github.com/MrMystery-Official/CustomAINBNodes and [exlaunch](https://github.com/shadowninja108/exlaunch).

This adds a new AINB node which zuggles the actor's currently equipped equipment. It also serves as a base template for anyone who wishes to add new AINB nodes.

Only works for 1.0.0 at the moment.
